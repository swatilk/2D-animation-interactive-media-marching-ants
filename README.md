# 2D-animation-interactive-media-marching-ants
This is a virtual reality project. I have developed an animation using a trigger image ie., the animation is triggered when the camera sees the trigger image. The software used for this project is aurasma studio. When the software is installed and when the camera is held on the trigger image, the animation starts playing and looping.
